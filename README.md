# Restaurant-Review-Sentiment-Analyzer

## Description
This project implements a **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** model to analyze restaurant reviews. The goal is to classify sentiments as **positive** or **negative** based on customer feedback.

### Features:

Data Preprocessing:
*  *Text cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization using TF-IDF.*

Model Training:
   *  *Naive Bayes with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.*  
   *  *Deep learning models using TensorFlow and PyTorch.*
   
Model Evaluation: 
*  *Performance metrics including confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, and recall.*

Visualization:
*  *Word clouds for positive and negative reviews, bar charts for model comparison, and review counts.*


### Libraries Used
*  Data manipulation and analysis: *pandas, numpy*
*  Visualization: *matplotlib, wordcloud*
*  Text preprocessing: *nltk*
*  Feature extraction: *scikit-learn*
*  Machine Learning: *scikit-learn*
*  Deep Learning: *tensorflow, torch*
